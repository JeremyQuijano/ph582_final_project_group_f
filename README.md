# PH582 Final Project - Group f
## Clustering Methods for Studying Galactic Components
Anna Parul and Jeremy Quijano

Our final project for PH482/582 Machine Learning for Spring 2021. We created clustering algorithms to perform chemical tagging on the FIRE-2 \url{https://fire.northwestern.edu}) cosmological zoom-in simulation. We used Milky-Way like galaxies from Latte suite. 

This repository contains all the programs and files necessary to run the different clustering methods we used for this project.
