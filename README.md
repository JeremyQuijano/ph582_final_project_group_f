# PH582 Final Project - Group f
## Clustering Methods for Studying Galactic Components
Anna Parul and Jeremy Quijano

Our final project for PH482/582 Machine Learning for Spring 2021. We created clustering algorithms to perform chemical tagging on the FIRE-2 (https://fire.northwestern.edu) cosmological zoom-in simulation data. We used Milky-Way like galaxies from Latte suite.
